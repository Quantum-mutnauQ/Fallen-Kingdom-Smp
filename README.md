# Fallen-Kingdom-Smp

This Modpack has a stunning, modern zombie apocalypse experience designed for players craving intense exploration, challenging gameplay, and action-packed combatâ€”whether it's slashing, stabbing, or shooting zombies. This modpack delivers semi-realistic gameplay where all crafting recipes and tech progression feel as close to reality as possible. You'll encounter authentic, real-life buildings that offer immersive customization, including loot that matches the building type. You can even claim a structure as your own, turning it into a fortified base to fend off relentless zombie hordes.

With handcrafted design and careful attention to detail, this is one of the finest zombie apocalypse modpacks available. Co-op play with more than two players is highly recommended to tackle the heightened difficulty and fully enjoy the experience!
